> We intend to deprecate n-logger some time in 2023. It will continue to work for now, but **it should not be used in new projects**. The recommended replacement is [Reliability Kit logger](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit/tree/main/packages/logger#readme). There's a [blog post outlining the changes here](https://financialtimes.atlassian.net/l/cp/yzsAm35t).

# n-logger [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/n-logger.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/n-logger) ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Financial-Times/n-logger.svg?style=popout)

This package provides a Winston wrapper which sends server-side logs to Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

_Please note_ that this package is not only used by the Customer Products team. Please be mindful of this as any changes may impact other teams, such as Internal Products, differently.


## Getting started

This package is compatible with the Node version defined by `engines.node` in `package.json` (run command `nvm use` to switch your local Node version to the one specified in `.nvmrc`) and is distributed on npm.

```bash
npm install --save @financial-times/n-logger
```

After installing the package you will need to configure your production application with the `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN` environment variable. If you are working on a `next-` application this will be specified in the shared secrets folder in Vault.


## Usage

```js
import logger from '@financial-times/n-logger';

logger.log('info', 'Saying hello');
logger.info('Saying hello');
logger.warn('Everythingâ€™s mostly cool');
logger.error('Uh-oh', { field: 'some value' });
logger.info({ event: 'UPDATE_NOTIFICATION', data: data });

const error = new Error('Whoops!');
logger.error('Uh-oh', error, { extra_field: 'boo' });
```

If using CommonJS modules:

```js
const logger = require('@financial-times/n-logger').default;
```


### Loggers

The default loggers are configured based on the presence of several environment variables. A `Console` logger is always registered and a `SplunkHEC` logger is registered depending on which variables are set:

  - **`MIGRATE_TO_HEROKU_LOG_DRAINS`:** Whether the app should rely on Heroku log drains in production. If this variable is set to an unempty string then the app will _not_ log directly to Splunk. Instead it will log JSON strings to the console which should be picked up by Heroku and forwarded on to Splunk. **Do not set this environment variable before configuring a Heroku log drain in your application**.

  - **`SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN`:** The Splunk token to use when manually sending logs to Splunk. If this is set to an unempty string then a SplunkHEC logger will be configured.

  - **`SPLUNK_LOG_LEVEL`:** The log levels to send to Splunk, used by both Heroku log drains and the SplunkHEC logger. Defaults to `warn`.

  - **`CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL`:** The log levels to send to the console. Defaults to `silly`. This environment variable is ignored in favour of `SPLUNK_LOG_LEVEL` when `MIGRATE_TO_HEROKU_LOG_DRAINS` is in use.

  - **`CONSOLE_LOG_UNCOLORIZED`:** Set to `true` to disable log coloring. By default console logs are colorized. This environment variable is ignored when `MIGRATE_TO_HEROKU_LOG_DRAINS` is in use as JSON logs are not colorized.


## Testing n-logger locally

If you are making a change to `n-logger` it is worth testing it locally to check it is sending logs successfully before merging.

1. Create a test.js file in the root of your local n-logger.
1. Add the following to this file:

  ```js
  const logger = require('./dist/main').default;

  logger.warn('Testing Testing Testing');
  logger.warn({ event: 'HELLO_WORLD', message: 'Testing 1 2 3', count: 5 }, {fizz: 'buzz'});
  ```

1. In the terminal `export NODE_ENV=production`, `export SYSTEM_CODE=next-foo-bar` and `export SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN={token}` (find this token in the `next/shared` folder in Vault).

1. Run `node test` in the terminal.
1. If everything is working correctly, you should be able to see your test logs in Splunk with the query `index=heroku source="/var/log/apps/heroku/ft-next-foo-bar.log"`.


### API

#### log(level, message, ...meta)

 * `level` can be silly, debug, verbose, info, warn or error
 * `message` is optional
 * any number of meta objects can be supplied, including `Error` objects
 * **IMPORTANT NOTE** - do not send errors as properties of other objects, e.g. `{event: 'My_EVENT', error}`. This will result in no details of the error being logged**

#### silly|debug|verbose|info|warn|error(message, ...meta)

#### addConsole(level = 'info', colorize = true, opts = {})

#### removeConsole()

#### addSplunkHEC(level = 'info', opts = {})

#### removeSplunkHEC()

#### clearLoggers()

#### addContext(metadata = {})

Additional `metadata` properties to be appended to every subsequent log call.
